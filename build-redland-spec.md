## Current Issues Identified

### 1. **Extremely Long Methods (Violating Single Responsibility Principle)**

**Problem**: Several methods exceed 150+ lines and handle multiple responsibilities.

**Affected Methods**:

- `_build_worker()` (232 lines) - SSH connection, file transfer, build execution, output monitoring
- `HostSection.render()` (195 lines) - Border drawing, header formatting, output display, line truncation  
- `BuildTUI.render()` (167 lines) - Complex UI rendering logic with multiple responsibilities

**Impact**: Difficult to understand, test, and maintain.

### 2. **Excessive Complexity in Text Formatting**

**Problem**: The `build_bordered_line()` function (95 lines) contains overly complex text truncation, padding, and ANSI color code handling.

**Impact**: Error-prone, hard to debug, and difficult to modify.

### 3. **Code Duplication**

**Problem**: Repeated patterns throughout the codebase:

- Status color/symbol logic with repetitive if-elif chains
- Border drawing logic repeated in multiple places
- String truncation logic duplicated across methods

**Impact**: Maintenance burden, inconsistent behavior, bugs.

### 4. **Poor Error Handling**

**Problem**:

- Generic exception catching (`except Exception:`)
- Inconsistent error handling patterns
- Missing specific error types

**Impact**: Difficult debugging, masked errors, unpredictable behavior.

### 5. **Magic Numbers and Hardcoded Values**

**Problem**: Hardcoded values scattered throughout:

- Timeout values (7200 seconds, 10 seconds)
- Render intervals (0.1, 0.2 seconds)
- Terminal margins (-2, -4, -8)
- File paths (`/tmp/build`)

**Impact**: Difficult to configure, maintain, and adapt to different environments.

### 6. **Threading Issues**

**Problem**:

- Heavy lock contention in `_build_worker`
- Thread safety concerns with shared data structures
- Potential race conditions

**Impact**: Performance issues, potential crashes, unpredictable behavior.

### 7. **Poor Separation of Concerns**

**Problem**: UI logic mixed with business logic, SSH operations mixed with build management.

**Impact**: Difficult to test, modify, and extend functionality.

### 8. **Inefficient Data Structures**

**Problem**:

- List-based output buffering with inefficient slicing
- Repeated dictionary lookups in loops
- Poor memory usage patterns

**Impact**: Performance degradation with large outputs.

### 9. **Debug Code in Production**

**Problem**: Debug logging statements and special handling code left in production.

**Impact**: Performance overhead, code clutter.

### 10. **Poor Naming and Documentation**

**Problem**: Unclear variable names, inconsistent naming conventions, missing type hints.

**Impact**: Reduced code readability and maintainability.
