# Build TUI Future Enhancements

## Overview

This document outlines proposed future enhancements for the Build TUI
application.

## Future Enhancement Opportunities

### 1. Enhanced Navigation Features

#### New Keyboard Shortcuts

* **SPACE**: Toggle pause/resume for focused host
* **'c'**: Clear log for focused host
* **'r'**: Restart build for focused host (if failed)

#### Advanced Host Management

* **Numbered selection**: Quick access with number keys (1-9) in menu
* **Host filtering**: Filter by status (all, active, completed, failed)
* **Search functionality**: Type to filter hosts by name

### 2. Batch Mode for CI/CD

#### Overview

A non-interactive batch mode for running builds in parallel on multiple hosts, suitable for CI/CD environments.

#### Features

* **Non-interactive output**: Console log-style output without TUI
* **Parallel execution**: Same concurrency management as TUI mode
* **Summary report**: Comprehensive build summary at completion
* **Command-line activation**: `--batch` or `--no-tui` flag

### 3. Build Script Integration Enhancements

#### Interface Improvements

* **Structured output format**: Standardize build script output for better parsing
* **Optional TUI mode**: `--tui-mode` flag for enhanced progress reporting
* **Configuration sharing**: Build script reads TUI preferences when available

#### Enhanced Coordination

* **Better step detection**: More robust parsing of build phases
* **Improved error categorization**: Enhanced error reporting and handling
* **Timing data integration**: More accurate progress estimation

### 4. Matrix Build Functionality

#### Overview

A matrix-build system that automatically discovers host capabilities and runs builds across different dimensions of compilers, operating systems, and architectures.

#### Discovery Phase

* **Host capability detection**: Automatically detect available compilers (gcc, clang, cc, g++)
* **OS identification**: Detect operating system and version (Debian, Ubuntu, etc.)
* **Architecture detection**: Identify CPU architecture (x86-64, ARM, etc.)
* **Compiler flags support**: Test for specific compiler flags and features
* **Dependency checking**: Verify required libraries and tools are available

#### Matrix Configuration

* **Compiler dimensions**: gcc/cc, clang/llvm, cc with specific flags, C++/g++
* **OS dimensions**: Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS, Alpine, etc.
* **Architecture dimensions**: x86-64, ARM64, ARM32, etc.
* **Custom dimensions**: User-defined build variants
* **Exclusion rules**: Skip incompatible combinations

#### Build Execution

* **Multi-build per host**: Run multiple matrix combinations on capable hosts
* **Resource optimization**: Distribute builds based on host capabilities
* **Dependency management**: Ensure proper toolchain setup for each combination
* **Result aggregation**: Collect and compare results across matrix dimensions

### 5. Performance and Scalability

#### Memory Optimization

* **Virtual scrolling**: Handle very large logs efficiently
* **Log buffer limits**: Configurable memory usage constraints
* **Background processing**: Non-blocking UI updates for better responsiveness

#### Advanced Features

* **Host grouping**: Organize hosts by categories or environments
* **Build templates**: Pre-configured build scenarios
* **Export functionality**: Save build results and configurations

## Implementation Priority

1. **High Priority**: Batch mode for CI/CD integration
2. **Medium Priority**: Enhanced navigation shortcuts and filtering
3. **Medium Priority**: Matrix build functionality (discovery and execution)
4. **Low Priority**: Build script integration improvements
5. **Future**: Advanced performance optimizations and templates

## Success Criteria

* **Maintain current functionality**: All existing features continue to work
* **Incremental implementation**: New features don't disrupt existing workflows
* **User feedback driven**: Features implemented based on user needs
* **Performance maintained**: Enhancements don't impact current performance
